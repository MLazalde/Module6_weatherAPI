# Module6_weatherAPI

When you open the application, you are presented with a landing page that has a search bar and a button. When a city is entered and the button is clicked, the current, and 5 day forecast is printed to the right. 

The application will also store the cities searched in local storage and create a button under the search for quick recall after searching for other cities. 

Since the city is stored in local storage, the previously stored cities should be available next time that the browser is opened. 

The application is using OpenWeatherMap's API to retrieve the data
